SuperCheapMode-override-infinite-research=Enabling this reduces the cost of infinite research by 4.
SuperCheapMode-modify-barrel-fill-empty-recipes=Enabling this reduces the amount of fluid needed to fill a barrel to one quarter, but the amount gained by emptying the barrel will remain the same, essentially enabling the player to generate more fluid endlessly. (Credit to Ignis-Blackfire for discovering this exploit.)
SuperCheapMode-super-tweak-nuclear-recipes=Enabling this will apply various tweaks to nuclear recipes, making them even cheaper and more accessible.
