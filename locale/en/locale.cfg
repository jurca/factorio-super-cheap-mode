[mod-setting-description]
SuperCheapMode-modify-barrel-fill-empty-recipes=Enabling this reduces the amount of fluid needed to fill a barrel to one quarter, but the amount gained by emptying the barrel will remain the same, essentially enabling the player to generate more fluid endlessly. (Credit to Ignis-Blackfire for discovering this exploit.)
